## The **mpes-kit** software suite

The software suite is developed to meet the data processing demands of the new generation of high-data-rate photoemission experimental setups, often featuring a time-of-flight photoelectron detector. This measurement technique is collectively named multidimensional photoemission spectroscopy (MPES), and includes angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) as a subsituent technique.

### Constituent packages

The main components of the software suite currently include the following,

- **mpes**: distributed statistical processing of single-electron data, artifact correction, measurement calibration, visualization and basic analysis tools for multidimensional photoemission spectroscopy. <br/>

- **pesfit**: baseline routines and benchmarks for semi-automated multi-band lineshape fitting. <br/>
[repo](https://github.com/mpes-kit/pesfit)<br />|<br />[doc](https://mpes-kit.github.io/pesfit/)

- **fuller**: machine-learning-based band structure reconstruction, band structure parametrization and automated photoemission-like data generation.<br/>
